# Dashboard-Pollution
This is a personal project I have been doing in order to try Kotlin as a server-side language.
This is a dashboard useful to keep an eye on pollution level of cities around the world.
The persistent layer is based on MongoDB.

As you will see, some properties are encrypt via jasypt.
Then, if you want to run this project, you will be needing to be registerd with your own API secret on https://openweathermap.org/api

Other improvements will come...
